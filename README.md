Flutter plugin that secures your secrets in keychain using biometric authentication (Fingerprint, Touch ID, Face ID...).


It uses:
 - [Locker on iOS](https://github.com/infinum/Locker)
 - [Goldfinger on Android](https://github.com/infinum/Android-Goldfinger)

## Migrate to 2.1.0

The models now accept named parameters instead of unnamed, e.g.:

```dart
RetrieveSecretRequest(
  key: 'key',
  androidPrompt: AndroidPrompt(title: 'title', cancelLabel: 'cancel'),
  iOsPrompt: IOsPrompt(touchIdText: 'description'),
)
```

## Usage

```dart
FlutterLocker.supportsBiometricAuthentication();
```
Checks if the devices has biometric capabilities no matter if they are configured and turned on.

```dart
FlutterLocker.canAuthenticate();
```
Checks if the devices has biometric capabilities that are configured and turned on.

```dart
await FlutterLocker.save(SaveSecretRequest(
  key: 'key',
  secret: 'secret',
  androidPrompt: AndroidPrompt(title: 'Authenticate', cancelLabel: 'Cancel'),
));
```
Saves the secret. On Android prompt is shown, while on iOS there is no need for the prompt when saving.

```dart
await FlutterLocker.retrieve(RetrieveSecretRequest(
  key: key,
  androidPrompt: AndroidPrompt(title: 'Authenticate', cancelLabel: 'Cancel'),
  iOsPrompt: IOsPrompt(touchIdText: 'Authenticate'),
));
```
Retrieves the secret. You need to provide a prompt for Android and iOS. Prompt for iOS is used only with TouchID. FaceID uses strings from `Info.plist`.

```dart
await FlutterLocker.delete('key');
```
Deletes the secret.

## Exceptions

For common exceptions, a `LockerException` is thrown.

Use `LockerException.reason` to find out what went wrong:

- `secretNotFound` - Happens when you try to retrieve a secret that was never saved for that key
- `authenticationCanceled` - User canceled the authentication prompt
- `authenticationFailed` - User failed authentication, e.g. by too many wrong attempts

For other exception, a `PlatformException` is thrown. You can use `PlatformException.message` to get more info.

## Notes

- iOS only: app will not show authentication dialog when saving (authentication will always succeed)
- please follow [Locker](https://github.com/infinum/Locker) and [Goldfinger](https://github.com/infinum/Android-Goldfinger) setup to prevent any issues

## Setup

### iOS

To use **Locker** you need to add the `NSFaceIDUsageDescription` to you `Info.plist`.

If `NSFaceIDUsageDescription` is not provided, the app will crash with the following error:
```
This app has crashed because it attempted to access privacy-sensitive data without a usage description.  The app's Info.plist must contain an NSFaceIDUsageDescription key with a string value explaining to the user how the app uses this data.
```

### Android

Ensure `MainActivity` extends `FlutterFragmentActivity`.

```kotlin
class MainActivity: FlutterFragmentActivity() {
    // ...
}
```

When showing authentication prompt, the app might crash on some Samsung devices if you don't use an appropriate theme: https://github.com/infinum/flutter-plugins-locker/commit/fcb1f6401d89f860d24ea9a75027d62a03e87926.
